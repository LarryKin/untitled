THEMES

1. hack and slash, 2D, RPG, roguelike, beat 'em up
2. platformed: risk of rain (fluidity), league of legened(combat skills, cc, etc), hotline miami(plot length?), gunpoint(stealth element). Problems I do not like: 2D platformer too ‘flat’. Add 3D element to it.


TO DO:
1. Sprites layers. Draw the sprites that are higher in y coordinate so that the sprite lower down on the screen will cover the sprite higher up
2. To solve sprite collions problem: set two transparent sprite box for human like character. One is a small box on the feet which detect unit collision so no one can overlap another; place a bigger box around the body of the sprite to detect other collision (such as attcked)
